                                In the bar, the most popular drink, a lethal "Dragon Punch." Night after
                                night PAZIMO Colaba is the fun party place in town. Along with the latest gossip,
                                you can enjoy live Latin jazz as background music. This new-generation Colaba
                                restaurant offers nice cookery, such as seafood ceviche scooped up with yucca,
                                and plantain chips, chicharr√≥nes (pork rinds), spicy crab cakes, and a host of
                                other dishes, such as marinated grilled meats. We applaud the chefs for
                                their use of root vegetables such as yucca. The red snapper and grouper are excellent,
                                andwe love the pumpkin and beans of every type. <br> <br> Address: <br>
